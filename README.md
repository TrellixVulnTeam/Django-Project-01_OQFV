# Django-Project-01
This is a small movie database clone sample which is mostly focused on basic User Interaction like 
User Registration , authentication , login and log out , pagination , comments, search engine etc.
The star rating framework is not fully functional yet as the one i found is broken so i have to find 
a way to manually configured it.

Here are screenshots of the website
